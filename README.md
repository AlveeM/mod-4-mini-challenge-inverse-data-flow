## Assignment

We're going to refactor our Spice Store app to better isolate out separate components, and understand how to pass data from a child to a parent using **inverse data flow**.

The started code should feel similar to the State & Events Mini Challenge. One thing has changed - we introduced a new component, `Filter`, that is a child of the `SpiceList` component.

Update the `Filter` and `SpiceList` components to complete these deliverables:

- [ ] When a user types in the search bar, the list of spices displayed should be filtered to match based on the text in the input field and the *notes* property of the spice. For example, if the user types 'warm', the list should show Allspice, Cardamom Pods, and Garam Masala.
- [ ] When the user clicks the checkbox next to '4 Star Only', the list of spices should be filtered to only display the spices with a *rating* of 4 or higher.

For both these deliverables, you'll need to set state in the `SpiceList` component after an event occurs in the `Filter` component.

## Tips
You will need to find a way to pass data up from a child to a parent component, instead of the normal flow of a parent passing down data to a child. Refer to the [Thinking In React - Inverse Data Flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-5-add-inverse-data-flow) section for an example.

Make sure you are comfortable passing callbacks around and understand the difference between a function *definition* and a function *invocation*.
